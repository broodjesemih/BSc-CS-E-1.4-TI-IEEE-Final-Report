abstract="HTML5-based mobile apps become increasingly popular as they leverage standard web technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS for saving development cost. Like web apps, they are built using JavaScript frameworks (e.g. jQuery) for making mobile websites responsive, faster, etc. Attackers may fire the events integrated into the frameworks for reusing sensitive APIs included in apps. Once the internal functions are accessed successfully, it may cause serious consequences (e.g. resource access). Its main advantage is that it is not required to inject malicious payloads for accessing to the system resources into apps. We define this vector of attacks as event-based remote attacks.",

abstract="Weather parameters required adequate data collection as air pressure, humidity and temperature at a specific time as well as location. It is important to gather the information as quickly as possible with the applicability to other areas. Nevertheless, terrestrial features like the natural contours with hills, mountains, river and ocean can hamper the data collection. Consequently, there is a requirement for the development of data collection system that can overcome this challenge without the impact of terrestrial features. This work proposes the solution as developing a data acquisition system with the help of DHT11 sensor to sense humidity and temperature information and uses a data processing unit as Arduino microcontroller. Server displays the collected information as graph or Graphical User Interface (GUI). Furthermore, this paper depicts the merits of smart sensors to overcome the issues during data collection of humidity/temperature as compared to other sensors. It is also appropriate for designing the other embedded systems to monitor ecological constraints. The results show the potential of the developed system in data acquisition.",
